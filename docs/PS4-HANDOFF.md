# PS4 attempt — 2026-10-17

Repository moved out of ScummVM-PS4 to a sibling `MickeyAndDonaldCollection/`.
Local branch: `ps4/openorbis-vulkan`; upstream base: `055e930`.
`origin` still points to Darhkfox/MickeyAndDonaldCollection. No GitHub fork or
push was performed; the optional fork question had not been answered.

Read [PS4.md](PS4.md) for build commands, controls, paths and limitations.
Do not rebuild or overwrite neighboring ScummVM/UT99 projects.

All three local ROM CRCs match. Original filenames remain untouched in `roms/`;
canonical read-back-verified copies are in `build/local-roms/`. Both locations
are Git-ignored. No ROM data is included in the PKG.

Evidence is under `build/ps4/` and the isolated
`build/emulator-profile/shadPS4/`. `emulator.log` records the original invalid
PM4 packet with semaphores. `emulator-fence.log` and `emulator-visual.log` record
the corrected single-fence presentation. The earlier serial-submit-marker test
is exploratory only; the final runtime does not require that marker.
The screenshots are private generated artifacts, not tracked source assets.

Host smoke: 600 frames per game, frame bounds valid, nonzero resampled audio and
exact core-state replay after save/load. Hashes over rendered frames:

- coi: `1cd6b3cc4c3925f8`
- qs: `305fb6d5df12fe24`
- woi: `dbcb1327d3d11e80`

Current test PKG SHA-256:
`a7c4a001da153bb720c20f9d9797323bb1d8aa4f1de05c4ee80ff5e512fcd14d`.
Always recheck the sidecar after rebuilding; the generated manifest contains
archive hashes and per-file package hashes.

Native graphics dependency checkouts (locally patched; revisions alone are not
sufficient to reproduce the archives):

- vulkan-ps4: `f4d940b723771b3fe637e8ac0704bb5d6ab19622`
- opengnm: `c51243f333a1a964894903da080a508f7af4d91f`
- opengnm-psbc: `a92a1228ea3a64e4be9f0e61c2a65a5aa7ffed92`

Next steps: inspect presentation pacing (~30 fps observed in shadPS4), add PS4
stereo audio output with proper queue pacing, verify controls/gameplay and then
physical console behavior. Full UI and second-player support are later work.
No physical-console execution, FTP transfer or installation has been performed.
